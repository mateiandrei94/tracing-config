/// Given it's purpose (i.e.: to dynamically create different layers based on some runtime criteria) the sifting layer will require a special writer as well as a special layer to sift on.
///
/// > **IMPORTANT** : The sifting layer will create (dynamically at runtime) a new `layer` for each set of different `sift_on` values.
/// >
/// > For example; to handle a user, the application enters a "user_handler" info span saving username as span data `info_span!("user_handler", username)`.
/// >
/// > While it does not make sense to create drastically different layers for each different user, having the same layer (or a copy or clone of it) write to a different file does (and it's the primary goal of the sifting layer).
/// > In the example above the `sift_on` value should be `sift_on = ["username"]`.
///
/// # Limitation
/// The limitation of the configuration file form of the sifting layer is the fact that it will essentially clone the sifted layer with a different writer.
/// This means that the writer **MUST** be different for each set of values declared in the `sift_on` field.
///
/// # Selector
/// This represents a [`SiftingLayerSelector`][struct@crate::tracing::SiftingLayerSelector].
///
/// To select for metadata :
/// - `${meta:level}` => selects level
/// - `${meta:name}` => selects name
/// - `${meta:target}` => selects target
/// - `${meta:module_path}` => selects module_path
/// - `${meta:file}` => selects file
/// - `${meta:line}` => selects line
///
/// Otherwise simply type in the name of the span data key as seen in the source code.
/// ```toml
/// sift_on = ["username", "${meta:module_path}"]
/// ```
///
/// # Writer
/// The configuration file form of the sifting layer only supports the [`FileWriter`][struct@FileWriter].
///
/// A sifting layer writer has additional/special placeholders in the form of `${sl:key}` and `${sl:meta:}` available as values in the configuration file.
/// These additional placeholders can be used in the following properties of the file writer :
/// - `directory_path`
/// - `file_name`
/// - `file_ext`
///
/// Here is a list of the available meta values :
/// - `${sl:meta:level}` => returns the level of the event
/// - `${sl:meta:name}` => returns the name of the event
/// - `${sl:meta:target}` => returns the target of the event
/// - `${sl:meta:module_path}` => returns the module path of the event
/// - `${sl:meta:file}` => returns the source file of the event
/// - `${sl:meta:line}` => returns the source line of the event
///
/// For any other `sift_on` non meta value the syntax is `${sl:key}` the word `meta` itself is allowed as a non meta key.
/// For example `info_span!("metadata_handler", meta)` use `sift_on = ["meta"]` and `${sl:meta}` to retrieve the value of meta.
///
/// > **IMPORTANT** : All values declared in the `sift_on` field must be used in either `directory_path`, `file_name` or `file_ext`.
/// > If meta values are required they must also be declared in the `sift_on` list.
/// >
/// > Example :
/// > ```toml
/// > # sifting layer
/// > sift_on = ["username", "${meta:level}"]
/// > # later on file writer
/// > directory_path = "${env:fs_app_logs}/rust/webapi/${sl:username}"
/// > file_ext = "${sl:meta:level}.log"
/// > # Notice we used both username and level
/// > ```
///
/// # Layer
/// The configuration file form of the sifting layer can only sift trough the [`FmtLayer`][struct@FmtLayer] or the [`JsonLayer`][struct@JsonLayer].
/// The programmatic form of the [`SiftingLayer`][struct@crate::tracing::SiftingLayer] can sift trough any type of [`Layer`][trait@ts::Layer].
///
/// The layer must **NOT** contain a `filter` itself. This is because the sifting layer creates fake layers and does not register them with tracing thus the filters (if any) are not registered either.
/// A filter on a sifted layer results in a panic at runtime.
///
/// The writer of a sifted layer must be `${sl:sifted}` otherwise it will be processed as a regular layer.
///
/// Example :
/// ```toml
/// [layer.webapi-sifted]
/// # a sifted layer MUST NOT include a filter
/// type = "fmt"
/// writer = "${sl:sifted}" # the writer MUST be the sifted writer
/// ```
///
